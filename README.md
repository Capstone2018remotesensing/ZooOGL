# Group 5 Executive Summary

Our project involves creating a detailed, interactive map for the users of the Calgary Zoo. First, we will perform a camera calibration to ensure that the equipment parameters are well defined for the photogrammetric data collection. Then, we will design a ground control network which will allow for high precision data adjustment, and craft a flight plan for the collection of the aerial images. Additionally, a ground survey of the chosen control points will also be performed in order to define our photogrammetric datum.

There is lots to see and do at the Calgary Zoo, and it is easy for those unfamiliar with the layout to waste time wandering around in an attempt to find their way. By starting with the high-resolution aerial images collected with the help of OGL Engineering, we will construct an interactive web-based map utilizing a GIS database which contains all relevant information that a Zoo guest could possibly need. From the location of the nearest restroom, to the scheduled times for the gorilla feeding, our map will provide that information. Helpful infographics will provide detailed information about the animals as guests journey around the zoo, and the map can even help with point to point navigation to help find their way. 

The scope of this project was initially just the aerial photography and a basic map, we feel like the added task of constructing an interactive georeferenced map is of a large enough scope to be considered a viable project on its own merits. However, given the nature of this project, it doesnâ€™t make much sense to work on it as two semi-separate teams. Thus, we feel like the scale and scope of this suggested project justifies the somewhat unusual group size.
